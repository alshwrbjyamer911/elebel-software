The **maximum range** of a **446 MHz PMR (Private Mobile Radio)** system — like walkie-talkies — depends heavily on the **environment**, **terrain**, **antenna quality**, and **device build**. However, **in Dubai (and the UAE in general)**, you are limited to:

* **446.000–446.200 MHz**
* **0.5 W ERP (Effective Radiated Power)**
* **Fixed antenna (non-removable)**
  → These are regulatory limits set by **TDRA**, and you **cannot legally increase power or use external antennas**.

### 📶 Real-World Range Estimates for PMR446 (0.5 W)

| **Environment**                        | **Typical Range**         | **Notes**                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dense urban (Dubai city)**           | 300 m – 1 km              | Tall buildings cause signal blockage/reflection                    |
| **Open suburban areas**                | 1 – 3 km                  | Fewer obstacles, flat terrain                                      |
| **Open rural/desert areas**            | **3 – 5 km (best case)**  | Flat, unobstructed line-of-sight; best-case conditions             |
| **Hilltop to hilltop / line of sight** | 5 – 8 km                  | Only if clear sight, elevated positions (e.g., rooftop to rooftop) |
| **Inside large buildings**             | 1–3 floors, 50–300 meters | Concrete and steel reduce signal severely                          |

### 🔧 Can You Extend the Range?

Not legally, in the UAE:

* ❌ **No external antennas**
* ❌ **No power amplifiers**
* ✅ Choose **better PMR446 radios** with good antennas (still fixed) and high-quality transceivers.
* ✅ Operate **from elevated positions** and avoid dense obstacles.

### 📌 Summary

| **Power Limit** | **Legal Max Range in Dubai**                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0.5 W ERP**   | \~1–3 km in typical areas, up to 5–8 km in perfect line-of-sight |
